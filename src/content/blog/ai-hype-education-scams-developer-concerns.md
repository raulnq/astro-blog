The rapid ascent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has sparked a parallel explosion in educational and training programs, leading to significant concern within the tech community regarding a phenomenon described as "AI smoke." Far from anxieties about job displacement by AI, the prevailing worry centers on the proliferation of misleading and low-quality courses. Observations indicate a surge in 'AI Master's' degrees and accelerated 'AI Engineer' programs, some promising career transitions in as little as three months. A common critique highlights that many of these offerings primarily focus on teaching the *use* of AI tools and existing frameworks, rather than imparting fundamental AI programming, research methodologies, or deep engineering principles.

A proposed 'smoke detector' framework suggests a strong inverse correlation between aggressive advertising investment and actual course quality. Key indicators of potentially low-value offerings often include buzzwords and marketing tactics such as 'free' access, 'guaranteed' job placement, 'unlimited power,' 'short time' to mastery, 'university' affiliation, 'certified' status, 'revolution,' 'increased income,' or 'limited time' promotions coupled with requests for personal contact information. These tactics, frequently seen across social media platforms, are seen as red flags for programs prioritizing enrollment figures over substantive education. Furthermore, community reactions highlight potential ethical and legal concerns; for instance, it has been noted that in some jurisdictions, like Argentina, advertising courses with 'engineer' or 'ingeniería' in their titles is prohibited unless the program constitutes an approved university degree, leading to questions about the nomenclature used by some fast-track 'AI Engineer' programs.
