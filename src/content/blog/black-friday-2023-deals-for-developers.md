The Black Friday shopping season brings notable price reductions across a range of products catering to software developers and tech enthusiasts. Leading the charge are computing solutions, with Apple's Mac Mini (M2, 256GB SSD, 16GB RAM) available for €599, representing a discount of approximately €120 on Amazon. While not its historical lowest, this deal offers substantial value compared to Apple's own Black Friday promotion, which provides an €80 gift card. For those favoring Windows or Linux, Geekom offers competitive mini PCs, including a base model from €400 and the Geekom GT1 (Intel processor) starting from €566 with substantial discounts exceeding €200, often featuring extensive connectivity such as eight USB ports, making them suitable for home servers or development environments.

Peripheral upgrades are also a highlight. High-resolution monitors, crucial for development, include an LG 27-inch 4K IPS display for €180, or a more advanced LG 27-inch 4K Nano IPS model with USB-C and a built-in hub for €297. Noise-cancelling headphones see significant price cuts, with the Sony WH-1000XM5 available for €246, offering near-flagship performance at a reduced cost compared to the newer XM6 (€379). Keyboards such as the Apple Magic Keyboard (€91), NuPhy Air 75 V2 (€109), and the low-profile Keychron K3 are also on offer, with some models featuring localized layouts. For storage and productivity, the Kindle e-reader is available for €90, marking its best price of the year.

Beyond hardware, essential developer services are deeply discounted. Don Dominio provides domain registration offers, with .com domains at €9.95 and .es domains at €4.95. Hostinger's VPS services (KVM2) are available with a 67% discount, further reducible by 10% with a special coupon, bringing a two-year subscription to €129 – a steep reduction from the regular €430. Additionally, content creation gear from Elgato, including streaming decks, microphone arms, and capture cards, are seeing discounts, with a capture card available for €80. Finally, for personal well-being, the Coros Pace 3 smartwatch, highly rated for its GPS and fitness tracking capabilities, is priced at €229, making it a compelling option for tracking physical activity.
