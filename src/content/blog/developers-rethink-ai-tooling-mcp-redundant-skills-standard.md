The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced in 2024 to streamline the exposure of tools to Large Language Models (LLMs), is increasingly being considered dispensable for typical developer workflows. While MCP's premise—to equip 'dumb' token-generating LLMs with external capabilities like web search or code execution—sounded promising, practical challenges have emerged. Chief among these issues is context pollution; integrating numerous MCP servers can overwhelm an AI application, leading to inefficient tool usage or even 'dumbing down' the model by flooding its context window with excessive metadata. Furthermore, many leading AI coding tools, such as Cursor, already incorporate essential developer functionalities like built-in web search, browser interaction, command-line execution, and Git integration, effectively rendering MCP redundant for these core tasks.

In contrast, an emerging standard known as 'Skills' is gaining attention for its ability to provide targeted, on-demand context to AI coding agents without the overhead of MCP. This approach involves adding a 'Skills' folder to a project, containing `skill.md` files with metadata (name, description) and specific prompts or contextual information. The innovation lies in its efficiency: only the skill names and descriptions are loaded into the AI's initial context (consuming minimal tokens), while the full skill content is loaded dynamically only when relevant to a task. This allows developers to define preferred coding patterns, introduce modern API usage (e.g., relative colors, Popover API), or embed specific architectural guidance (e.g., best practices for React `useEffect`). Skills can also be extended with executable scripts and external references, enabling custom tooling or knowledge bases without polluting the core context, thereby empowering AI to act more intelligently and align with developer intent without constant manual prompting.
