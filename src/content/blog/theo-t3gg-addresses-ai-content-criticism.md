Theo, the prominent tech content creator behind T3.gg, recently addressed growing community sentiment that his channel has disproportionately shifted towards AI-centric videos, driven by financial incentives. He strongly refuted accusations of 'shilling' AI, emphasizing a strict personal policy against accepting dedicated sponsored videos on topics he lacks genuine interest in, regardless of compensation. Citing an internal FAQ for potential sponsors, Theo revealed that he consistently rejects offers for dedicated videos, progressively increasing the price with each refusal, underscoring his commitment to authentic content over monetary gain. He further clarified that his business ventures, such as T3 Chat, and personal investments in AI companies, are direct *results* of his evolving excitement and conviction in AI tools, not the cause of his content choices.

The content creator explained that his video topics are primarily dictated by his personal excitement, unique insights he can offer, and crucially, whether the audience cares enough for him to invest significant effort. He highlighted a noticeable shift in viewership dynamics, where average non-AI development videos now struggle to gain traction compared to AI topics, impacting his ability to meet sponsor viewership guarantees without financial penalty. This perceived 'chasm' in audience interest, coupled with his own evolving perspective on AI from skepticism to full adoption following pivotal moments like GPT-5, significantly influences his content planning. Theo stressed his deeply personal involvement in every stage of his content creation—from topic ideation to scripting and production—distinguishing his approach from larger channels that often rely on external writers, and asserting that every word spoken in his videos reflects his genuine beliefs or sourced information.
