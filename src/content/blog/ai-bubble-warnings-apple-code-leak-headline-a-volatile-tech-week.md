The tech world is abuzz following the unexpected leak of the Apple App Store's complete frontend source code. This significant exposure, including TypeScript, internal references, and developer comments, was attributed to source maps inadvertently left active in production environments. Apple responded with aggressive DMCA takedowns across GitHub, underscoring the code's sensitivity and fueling community reactions, including covert distribution via steganography. Meanwhile, cybersecurity failures were implicated in a high-profile jewel heist at the Louvre Museum, where critical server passwords were shockingly simple ("Louvre," "Thales") and outdated Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003 systems remained in use, despite previous audit warnings.

Adding to market volatility, renowned investor Michael Burry, known for 'The Big Short,' is placing a substantial bet against the AI sector, specifically Nvidia and Palantir. Burry points to a potential "depreciation fraud" by major hyperscalers (Meta, Google, Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon) who are reportedly extending the estimated useful life of their rapidly evolving AI hardware in their accounting, artificially inflating earnings. This practice could result in a $176 billion overestimation in depreciation by 2028, sparking concerns about the sustainability of current AI investments, especially with SoftBank's recent sale of Nvidia shares to invest heavily in OpenAI. Coincidentally, the European Union is pushing an "Omnibus package" of regulatory simplifications. Key proposals include moving from an "opt-in" to an "opt-out" model for cookie consent, potentially eliminating ubiquitous cookie banners, and allowing companies to use personal data for AI training without explicit consent under certain protective measures. These regulatory shifts aim to foster innovation but are already drawing criticism from privacy advocates concerned about weakened data protection.
