Stack Overflow, once a critical resource for developers, is experiencing an unprecedented decline in user engagement, with monthly question volumes plummeting to historic lows. Data from Stack Exchange indicates the platform peaked in 2014 with over 200,000 monthly questions, maintaining strong activity into mid-2020 with 186,000 questions. However, a significant downturn began shortly thereafter, accelerating dramatically following the launch of ChatGPT in 2023. The platform recorded only 3,862 questions in December, marking its lowest monthly volume since its inception in 2008, which saw 3,749 questions. Projections for January 2026 suggest an even further drop, with only 320 questions logged so far and an estimated total of approximately 2,000 questions, starkly contrasting 60,000 monthly questions recorded in 2023. This severe reduction in activity follows the platform's acquisition by Prosus for $1.8 billion in June 2021, a period already witnessing the onset of this downward trend.

This precipitous drop has ignited a critical debate within the tech community concerning the evolving relationship between human-generated content and artificial intelligence. One perspective attributes the decline not only to the rise of AI tools but also to a perceived increase in community toxicity on Stack Overflow. This view posits a fundamental paradox: if incentives for creating quality human content diminish, where will AI systems acquire the diverse and nuanced data necessary for genuine learning and evolution, warning of potential 'model collapse' where AI models become repetitive and generate low-quality synthetic data. Conversely, another expert, Carlos Santana, argues that AI in programming benefits from code verifiability through execution and tests, suggesting leading AI labs like those behind Codex and Copilot possess superior, direct feedback data from user interactions. However, this counter-argument is met with skepticism by some, who contend that passing tests represents a limited aspect of programming quality, failing to capture critical elements like business logic, maintainability, design, and contextual nuances. They emphasize that the rich, human-driven discussions—explaining 'why' and debating different approaches—found in platforms like Stack Overflow provide a high-quality signal for AI training that synthetic or simply 'verifiable' data cannot replicate, highlighting the continued importance of supervised learning for robust LLM development.
