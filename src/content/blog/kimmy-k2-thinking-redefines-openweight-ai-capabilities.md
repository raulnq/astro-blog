Moonshot has unveiled Kimi K2 Thinking, a new open-weight large language model that is quickly making waves across the AI community for its unprecedented capabilities, particularly in complex tool-calling scenarios. Initial reports indicate the model can execute 200 to 300 consecutive tool calls without human intervention, marking it as a potentially best-in-class tool-calling model, surpassing even proprietary alternatives. Beyond tool-calling, Kimi K2 Thinking demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam and BrowseComp, while competing neck-and-neck with models such as GPT-5 and Sonnet 4.5 on coding challenges including SWE bench verified and LiveCodeBench. Despite being developed by a China-based team, it has garnered significant praise for its exceptional English writing quality and consistency, outperforming some leading American models in creative writing tasks.

However, the model's impressive performance comes with notable considerations. Kimi K2 Thinking is a massive model, featuring a trillion parameters and weighing in at 594GB, making it the largest open-weight model to date. While using INT4 quantization model for easier deployment, its sheer size presents significant infrastructure challenges, with Moonshot's official hosting currently being the primary reliable provider due to intricate tool-calling consistency requirements. It exhibits high token usage, consuming 140 million tokens on the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, significantly more than comparable models like GPT-5. Performance metrics indicate slower transaction processing speeds (18 TPS standard, 85 TPS turbo) compared to some frontier models, and initial code generation tests have shown mixed results for implementation details. The model operates under a modified MIT license, requiring commercial products or services with over 100 million monthly active users or $20 million in monthly revenue to prominently display "Kimi K2" in their user interface. The model's release highlights the rapid advancements from Chinese AI labs and the increasing pressure on established American AI giants, particularly in areas like interled thinking where K2 Thinking is an early adopter.
