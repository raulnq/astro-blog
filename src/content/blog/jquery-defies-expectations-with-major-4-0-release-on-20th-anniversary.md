The venerable JavaScript library, jQuery, has marked its 20th anniversary with the unexpected release of version 4.0.0 on January 17th. Introduced by John Resig at Bar Camp in New York City on January 14, 2006, jQuery has remained arguably the most widely adopted JavaScript utility library in history. This major version, arriving a decade after its last, signals a committed future for the library, surprising many in an era dominated by modern frameworks and native browser capabilities. The update is a significant milestone, carrying breaking changes necessary for its continued evolution.

jQuery 4.0 introduces several critical updates, reflecting modern web standards and security considerations. Notably, it officially drops support for Internet Explorer 10, though IE 11 remains compatible for now, with plans to remove it entirely in the upcoming jQuery 5.0. The library has migrated to ECMAScript Modules (ESM), a substantial architectural shift, and has removed numerous previously deprecated APIs whose functionalities are now natively available in modern JavaScript. Performance enhancements are also a key feature, with the 4.0 release boasting a smaller footprint than ever before due to the removal of polyfills and redundant methods. The continued development of jQuery underscores its vital role in maintaining the millions of websites that still rely on it, ensuring ongoing security, performance, and stability without necessitating costly migrations to newer technologies. Its enduring presence and influence, even inspiring native browser APIs like `document.querySelector`, highlight jQuery's indelible legacy in the web development ecosystem.
