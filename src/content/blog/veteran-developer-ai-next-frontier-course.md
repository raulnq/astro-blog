A new 40-minute, 11-lesson course designed to educate developers on leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been released as part of a mentoring program. The curriculum provides a high-level overview of the AI landscape, covering distinctions between Large Language Models (LLMs) and agents, the creation of custom GPTs, and two primary methods for integrating AI into application development: co-editors and AI-driven solutions. This initiative aims to equip developers with a foundational understanding of AI's practical applications and how to navigate the emerging technological ecosystem.

The course creator, identifying as an "old school developer," views AI not as a threat but as the "next level" in software development, presenting a "huge range of opportunities." Drawing parallels to the early 1990s transition from thick client (VB6, C++) to web development, the developer asserts that early adopters of new technologies, despite initial resistance from established paradigms, consistently thrive. This perspective frames AI as the modern equivalent of opportunities seen with early web development or the emergence of highly prized skills like early React development. The strong recommendation is for developers to "jump into the AI game," emphasizing its current position as a high-probability area for success and career advancement, akin to Bitcoin's early investment phase in terms of potential.
