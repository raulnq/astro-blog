A well-known, successful web-based company, remaining anonymous, has achieved significant improvements in its software development lifecycle through strategic process changes. Initially operating with a 'mini waterfall' approach centered around bi-weekly releases, the company faced substantial lead times. On average, a feature took 151 hours to develop, and the entire pull request (PR) lifecycle extended to 253 hours, involving multiple queues for code review, QA, and design. A critical analysis, replicating findings by Dragon Steepanovich, revealed that traditional code reviews were largely ineffective for larger changes, with complexity inversely correlating with the utility of review comments. Even attempts at automated commenting were dismissed as spam by developers, highlighting a systemic issue in their review process.

Inspired by these findings, an engineering lead spearheaded an experiment focusing on pair programming. Despite initial managerial skepticism regarding potential productivity losses and quality degradation (due to the absence of traditional PRs for paired work), teams committed to developing at least 30% of features via pair programming. For these features, traditional code reviews were entirely skipped. After a 100-day trial, the results were dramatic: the average feature development time plummeted from 151 hours to 44 hours (with a median of 22 hours), and the average pull request cycle time was reduced from 253 hours to 130 hours. Furthermore, the company reported a reduction in production bugs and an increase in features delivered per release, validating that pair programming not only maintained but enhanced productivity and quality. The company now plans to further optimize its process by exploring trunk-based development, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD, also known as Behavior Driven Development) to eliminate remaining PR overheads and accelerate delivery even further.
