Cursor has launched Cursor 2.0, introducing a significant overhaul to its AI-powered development environment, headlined by a new agent-centric interface and the release of Composer, its proprietary frontier large language model. The new "Agents" mode, accessible via a toggle or `Command+E`, shifts the user experience from a file-centric IDE to a dynamic hub for managing parallel AI agent operations. Composer, developed by Jacob—formerly of Super Maven and Tab 9—is hailed as a breakthrough, achieving speeds up to four times faster than similarly intelligent models and completing most coding tasks in under 30 seconds. This model, optimized for high-speed agent use and multi-file editing, leverages reinforcement learning from real-world software engineering challenges within large codebases; an early version of Composer was previously known as 'Cheetah.'

Beyond the core interface and model, Cursor 2.0 integrates robust features designed to streamline complex development workflows. It offers built-in Git work tree support, enabling developers to run multiple AI agents and tasks in parallel without interference. The platform now supports simultaneous execution of multiple models, allowing for direct comparison of results—a feature noted to significantly improve output quality for challenging tasks. A redesigned code review flow presents changes in a VS Code Monaco-style rendering, facilitating quick and comprehensive assessment of agent-generated modifications. Perhaps one of the most impactful additions is the native browser tool, empowering AI agents to autonomously test UI changes, interact with web pages, and iterate on fixes until the desired outcome is achieved. Early feedback from developers and internal users describes the update as "genuinely impressive" and a "truly insane" overhaul, indicating a strong positive reception for its transformative capabilities.
