Google's highly anticipated Gemini 3 is reportedly on the verge of release this week, with some users already gaining early access. Reports indicate that enabling 'canvas mode' on iPhone and Android devices can activate the new model, offering a glimpse into its advanced capabilities. A notable highlight is Gemini 3's robust design generation, described by early testers as 'brutal' and 'spectacular.' Examples include the creation of complex UI elements, brutalist websites, and even Minecraft-themed structures. However, observers have noted a potential pattern of design repetition, suggesting Gemini 3 might leverage a library of sophisticated pre-established templates to achieve its visually striking outputs, providing a highly satisfactory user experience despite not always generating entirely novel designs.

Further solidifying the imminent launch, Google CEO Sundar Pichai cryptically engaged with a Polymarket prediction post, where market participants are heavily wagering on a November 22nd launch (90% probability) or by November 30th (94% probability). This activity underscores significant industry anticipation. Concurrently, presumptive benchmarks for Gemini 3 are surfacing, with early measurements on platforms like M Arena showing improved scores over previous Gemini checkpoints. While official benchmarks are awaited, these early indicators suggest a performance upgrade. Separately, a leaked code snippet, purportedly for Gemini 2.0 API usage, drew developer criticism for its syntax, formatting inconsistencies, and unusual font choice, highlighting the developer experience aspect of the wider Gemini ecosystem.
