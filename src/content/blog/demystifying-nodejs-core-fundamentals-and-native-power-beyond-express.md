A recent Node.js bootcamp session emphasized a foundational approach to learning the JavaScript runtime, contrasting it with common methods that prematurely introduce frameworks like Express. The instruction defined Node.js as an asynchronous, event-driven JavaScript runtime environment, executing outside the browser using Chrome's V8 engine, making it ideal for I/O operations, APIs, servers, and data processing. Node.js was highlighted as central to the JavaScript ecosystem, underpinning both frontend tooling (e.g., Vite, Next.js, ESLint, testing runners) and backend development for APIs, microservices, and WebSockets, as well as command-line tools and automation scripts.

The practical demonstration covered essential Node.js functionalities, beginning with installation via version managers and the distinction between LTS and Current versions. Participants learned to leverage Node's native modules, including `fs/promises` for file system interactions (reading, writing, recursive directory creation), `path` for cross-platform path manipulation, and `os` for retrieving system information. Dependency management using npm was explored, detailing `package.json` for project configuration, `package-lock.json` for exact version snapshots, and the implications of semantic versioning (`semver`) and the `caret` symbol. A critical security aspect, Node.js's permission model, was introduced, enabling fine-grained control over file system and network access. The session culminated in building a basic HTTP server without Express, demonstrating request/response handling, dynamic routing, content type negotiation (including JSON consumption via `stream/consumers/json`), environment variable integration, and the use of Node's `watch` mode for automatic server restarts. The future curriculum plans to transition to Express to illustrate its benefits while maintaining a deep understanding of underlying Node.js mechanics, followed by production deployment and database integration.
