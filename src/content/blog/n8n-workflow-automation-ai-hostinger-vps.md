The landscape of software development is continually evolving, pushing for greater efficiency and automation. A recent demonstration highlighted N8N, an open-source workflow automation platform, as a powerful solution for orchestrating complex tasks with code-level precision, enhanced by artificial intelligence and extensive integrations. N8N distinguishes itself by offering a visual editor where users can design intricate workflows by connecting various nodes, ranging from traditional application APIs and HTTP requests to server commands, webhooks, and even sub-workflows. Its versatile deployment options allow users to choose between cloud execution or self-hosting on their own servers, providing flexibility and control over their automation infrastructure. The platform supports a wide array of triggers—including scheduled events, application events, HTTP calls, and chat messages—and provides access to over 7,000 community-contributed templates, significantly accelerating development cycles.

A practical demonstration showcased N8N's capabilities by automating a daily email notification for upcoming running races in Barcelona. The workflow initiated with a scheduled trigger, followed by an HTTP POST request to the Rock the Sport API to retrieve race data based on specific criteria. Initially, the output was a raw JSON payload sent directly via Gmail. However, the workflow was then enhanced by integrating OpenAI (specifically the GPT-5.1 model) to transform the unstructured JSON data into a human-readable HTML format, suitable for direct email delivery. This integration exemplified N8N's ability to leverage AI for intelligent data transformation, turning complex data into actionable insights without manual intervention. For self-hosting, the demonstration highlighted Hostinger's Virtual Private Server (VPS) offerings, emphasizing pre-configured N8N operating system images (clean, queue mode, or with 100 starter flows) that simplify deployment. Hostinger's KVM2 VPS plan was noted for its performance specifications (8GB RAM, 100GB NVMe SSD, 8TB bandwidth) and attractive Black Friday pricing, further positioning N8N as an accessible and robust choice for developers seeking scalable and intelligent automation solutions.
