A lively Q&A session ignited with a critical examination of Anthropic's reported shift from MCP (Model-Client Protocol) and tool calls to 'Skills,' with no clear alternative to MCP presented. Experts Victor and Scott largely dismissed 'Skills' as merely glorified prompts lacking the robust protocol definition of MCP. The consensus underscored that MCP is a protocol, akin to HTTP, designed for machine-to-machine communication, while 'Skills' appear to be a proprietary, directory-based approach. The discussion highlighted a perceived neglect by Anthropic of the MCP specification, despite their foundational role in its creation, with Microsoft and Cursor cited as more active contributors. The community expressed a strong desire for an 'MCP 2.0' that would support code-first tool calling, enabling LLMs to write and execute code against APIs, with mentions of MCPUI.dev as an innovative project aiming to integrate interactive UI components into the protocol for richer user experiences.

The conversation expanded to cover the value and challenges of Backstage, emphasizing its role as a portal and framework for internal developer platforms, requiring dedicated product management and engineering investment. CI/CD solutions, including GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Tekton, were discussed, with a prevailing sentiment that true conceptual innovation in this space is scarce, and Dagger was framed as a replacement for shell scripts, not CI itself. The future of Kubernetes was envisioned with higher-level abstractions like Crossplane making its low-level constructs invisible to end-users, rather than being replaced by opinionated services like Azure Container Apps. The panel also addressed the practicalities of AI agents, advocating for breaking down tasks, using deterministic tools, and implementing hooks for validation, stressing that serious work with AI currently requires human supervision. Furthermore, the influence of AI on DevOps and cloud jobs was acknowledged as profound, enhancing senior engineers' productivity but posing risks for juniors, with AI best suited for solving 'unknowns' rather than replacing established automation.
