Traditional backend development, often perceived as simply choosing a language and framework, encompasses complex tasks such as designing logic, ensuring scalable architecture, data validation, security configuration, and API construction. However, the software development landscape is rapidly shifting, offering a suite of modern tools designed to abstract away server management, reduce configurations, and minimize boilerplate code. Among these innovations are Serverless Functions, which enable developers to deploy small, event-driven code snippets to cloud platforms. These functions execute only when invoked via a simple HTTP endpoint, eliminating the need for server provisioning and manual scaling. This pay-per-use model is ideal for specific tasks like form submissions, online payments, or on-demand PDF generation, fitting seamlessly into JAMstack architectures. Prominent platforms include AWS Lambda (offering high customizability and integration with other AWS services), Netlify Functions, Vercel Functions, Cloudflare Workers, and Railway, with API Gateways often used to unify multiple functions into a single logical backend.
