The software development ecosystem is buzzing with the emergence of Set, a new code editor engineered from the ground up with Rust, diverging sharply from the prevalent trend of VS Code forks. Positioned as the fastest and most functional editor currently available, Set delivers an uncompromised performance experience. Developers report instantaneous loading times, highly fluid interaction, and a terminal that avoids common glitches seen in other editors. Its native architecture and GPU rendering contribute to rapid file navigation and project opening, making quick edits and large file handling remarkably efficient across Linux, Windows, and Mac platforms.

Set distinguishes itself with an AI-first design philosophy, integrating intelligent coding assistance directly into its core. Beyond offering its own AI service with robust autocompletion and code generation, Set supports a wide array of external LLM providers and AI agents like Cloud Code, OpenCode, and TestSprite. Its Multi-Chat Protocol (MCP) servers enable AI integration with external services such as GitHub, Supabase, and Notion, exemplified by Context Seven for real-time documentation updates for LLMs, and TestSprite for AI-driven automated testing. The editor also boasts built-in collaborative panels akin to VS Code's Live Share, extensive keymap customization including Vim and Helix modes, and a comprehensive extensions marketplace for themes, icons, and language servers, offering a complete and highly adaptable development environment.
