Engineering teams frequently encounter user complaints about inconsistent application performance, where response times fluctuate dramatically, yet conventional metrics like average response times and service health dashboards appear acceptable. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental challenge in modern distributed systems: a single user action can trigger a complex cascade of dozens of independent requests across numerous microservices, making the actual request path and potential bottlenecks opaque to traditional monitoring tools. Without the ability to correlate these disparate operations, critical questions remain unanswered, such as which specific microservices or internal operations (e.g., database queries, external API calls, business logic) are introducing delays, or whether issues stem from inter-service communication or network latency.

Distributed tracing, enabled by OpenTelemetry, emerges as the essential solution to this visibility gap. OpenTelemetry provides a standardized, vendor-neutral framework to track a single logical transaction across all service boundaries. It achieves this through 'traces,' which represent the complete journey of a user request, and 'spans,' which are individual units of work within a trace, capturing timing data, attributes (metadata), and events, all linked by 'context propagation.' While automatic instrumentation offers a quick start for common frameworks, manual instrumentation is recommended for gaining granular control over custom business logic and reducing irrelevant data. Key components of OpenTelemetry tracing include Trace IDs, Span IDs, parent-child relationships, span attributes leveraging semantic conventions for consistent data, and various span kinds (internal, client, server, producer, consumer). For high-traffic production environments, sampling strategies—such as head-based or more intelligent tail-based sampling—are crucial for managing data volume and cost. The widespread adoption of the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) allows teams to instrument their applications once and export trace data to any compatible backend, from open-source options like Jaeger to commercial platforms like DataDog, eliminating vendor lock-in and providing unparalleled insight into system behavior.
