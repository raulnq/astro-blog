During a live 'Ask Us Anything' session, experts Victor and Scott navigated a wide array of topics, offering insights into the latest in software development and cloud-native ecosystems. The discussion kicked off with reactions to AWS re:Invent announcements, noting the impressive speed of session recordings and the ongoing tension as AWS introduces services that might compete with its partners. A core theme that emerged was the judicious application of AI: speakers emphasized that AI should be reserved for non-repeatable tasks and creative problem-solving, rather than automating standard, scriptable processes like policy comparisons, for which tools like Kyverno CLI's dry run capabilities are more appropriate. On the networking front, there was a strong recommendation to migrate from the discontinued `ingress-nginx` to `Gateway API` for enhanced performance and scalability, particularly when handling mixed workloads like streaming and API calls. For fleet management of 40+ Kubernetes clusters, a dedicated fleet management tool was advised over a custom `Flux` + `Crossplane` build, although a 'brain cluster' model was suggested for self-managed solutions.

The conversation also covered best practices for implementing Backstage, advocating for auto-ingestion of resources, gamifying metadata adoption through tech insights scorecards, and a critical stance on adapting the organization to the tool's intended model rather than vice-versa, to fully leverage its benefits. The deployment of `Cilium` was highlighted as a critical decision to be made during cluster creation, with migration to existing clusters deemed a significant operational challenge. Platform standardization was identified as crucial for efficiency, emphasizing API exposure and initially targeting 80% of use cases before addressing outliers. While `Crossplane` was noted for its on-premise friendliness—especially when Terraform providers are available—the experts expressed skepticism about new container alternatives like 'Flux Uncontained' if they compromise ecosystem compatibility. The discussion concluded with enthusiasm for ephemeral environments and remote development (favoring `devcontainers` and `GitHub Codespaces`), and a clear distinction between `Tekton` for CI workflows and `Argo CD`/`Flux` for GitOps-driven continuous delivery.
