The rapidly evolving field of agentic engineering, where AI assists in code development, is seeing a surge in specialized tools. Prominent solutions include Anthropic's Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, and Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot, alongside others like Google Antigravity and Gemini CLI. These tools generally bifurcate into Command Line/Terminal User Interfaces (CLIs/TUIs) such as Claude Code and OpenCode, and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Cursor and VS Code/GitHub Copilot. While CLI tools prioritize core agentic functionality and offer IDE integrations for change previews, IDE-based platforms extend capabilities with advanced auto-completion—notably strong in Cursor—complementing their AI chat interfaces. This distinction often reflects a strategic choice by CLI developers to focus on agent builders rather than full IDE maintenance.

A key differentiator among these platforms lies in their supported AI models and business models. Claude Code, being an Anthropic product, offers tight integration with Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus, recently adding Olama support for local open-source models. Conversely, OpenCode, Cursor, and VS Code/GitHub Copilot provide broader model access, including the highly-regarded GPT-5.2 Codex and various providers, often leveraging existing subscriptions like GitHub Copilot. OpenCode stands out as an open-source solution offering optional paid tiers, in contrast to the heavily subsidized models of VC-funded Cursor and Microsoft-backed GitHub Copilot. Despite feature parity in core agentic capabilities like sub-agents, skills, and memory/rules files (e.g., `agents.md`), the ecosystem currently lacks standardization. Developers often face varied configurations, with `Claude Skills` showing wider compatibility across platforms, yet many tools maintain proprietary folder structures for skills and rules, signaling an early, fragmented stage of ecosystem maturity.

In terms of performance and code quality, developers generally find all leading tools to be 'decent,' with no single platform consistently outperforming others across all scenarios. Observations suggest Claude Code paired with Anthropic's Opus models often yields robust results due to inherent integration synergies. However, tools like OpenCode, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot are frequently preferred for tasks requiring access to a wider array of models, such as GPT-5.2 Codex, or for benefiting from IDE functionalities like comprehensive diff views for complex code edits. Ultimately, the effectiveness of any agentic engineering tool heavily relies on the developer's skill in crafting precise prompts, providing ample context, and effectively leveraging features like agents and skills. This underscores that agentic engineering remains a collaborative process between human expertise and AI capabilities, where thoughtful interaction dictates success.
