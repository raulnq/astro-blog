Anthropic, the AI research company behind advanced models like Claude Code, Claude Agent, and Claude Sonnet, has announced its acquisition of Bun, the high-performance JavaScript runtime. This move marks a significant development for the web ecosystem, bringing together a leading AI innovator with a project celebrated for its unprecedented speed and all-in-one capabilities.

Bun has rapidly gained traction in the developer community as a challenger to established runtimes like Node.js and Deno. It distinguishes itself not only as an incredibly fast JavaScript runtime but also as a comprehensive toolkit, incorporating a package manager (replacing npm), a test runner (replacing Vitest), and a bundler (replacing Vite) natively. Following the acquisition, Anthropic has committed to maintaining Bun as an open-source, MIT-licensed project. The existing Bun team will continue its work, ensuring its public availability on GitHub and a roadmap that remains focused on JavaScript tooling, Node.js compatibility, and its ambition to become the default server-side JavaScript runtime.

The acquisition addresses long-standing questions regarding Bun's long-term sustainability and monetization, providing a robust corporate backing that its creator, Jared Summer, had previously sought for the project. Anthropic plans to leverage Bun's performance to enhance its own developer tools, including Claude Code and Claude SDK, and to improve AI-related functionalities within Bun. This integration is expected to accelerate Bun's development even further, solidifying its position as a reliable choice for production environments and potentially unlocking new synergies between high-performance JavaScript execution and artificial intelligence applications.
