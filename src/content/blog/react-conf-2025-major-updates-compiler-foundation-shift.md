React Conf 2025 introduced significant API enhancements designed to streamline development and improve application performance. A key addition in React 19.2 is the `useEffectEvent` hook, which addresses challenges associated with `useEffect` dependency arrays. This new API allows developers to use functions within `useEffect` without needing to declare them in the dependency array, thus preventing unnecessary effect re-runsâ€”a common source of bugs, exemplified by recent incidents like Cloudflare's dashboard outage. The conference also unveiled the `Activity` component, a sophisticated alternative to `display: none` that preserves component state across visibility changes and deprioritizes rendering work for hidden elements. Further innovations include the `ViewTransition` component, available in React's Canary version for animating UI transitions, and the new capability to pass a `ref` to a fragment, simplifying interactions with underlying platform APIs.

Beyond new APIs, two pivotal announcements impact the React ecosystem's future. The long-anticipated React Compiler officially reached version 1.0 stability. This compiler is poised to automatically optimize applications, largely eliminating the need for manual performance optimizations through `useMemo` and `useCallback`, which can often introduce complexity and sometimes degrade performance if not applied judiciously. This milestone aims to simplify performance management for developers. Equally significant is the announcement that React and React Native, after 15 years under Meta, will transition to an independent foundation with its own technical governance structure. This move is designed to ensure the longevity and independent evolution of the framework. Separately, details emerged about Remix 3, an upcoming framework from the creators of Remix, React Router, and Reach Router, which promises a new approach centered on web fundamentals, TypeScript, and JSX, offering an alternative vision for web development.
