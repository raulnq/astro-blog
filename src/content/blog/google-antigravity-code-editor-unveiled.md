Google has officially launched Antigravity, a new AI-powered code editor now available in public preview. Identified as a fork of Winsurf, a codebase with ties to the Visual Studio Code ecosystem, Antigravity immediately stands out with a robust Agent Manager. This feature enables developers to offload lengthy background tasks, monitor parallel executions, and leverage an innovative "Inbox" system to review and comment on agent-proposed changes before implementation. A unique Playground feature allows for rapid project prototyping from scratch, while its integrated browser, controlled directly by AI agents, offers visual playback and comprehensive testing capabilities, demonstrating real-time in-browser interactions. Antigravity supports Windows, macOS, and Linux from day one, ensuring broad accessibility and offering the ability to import preferences from VS Code, Winsurf, and Cursor.

The public preview of Antigravity provides complimentary access to powerful AI models, including Gemini 3 Pro (High and Low reasoning), Cloud Sonet 4.5, and the open-source GPT OSS model. Users benefit from unlimited autocompletion and command requests, though initial observations indicate stricter rate limits for the high-reasoning Gemini 3 Pro model. The editor's requirement for Google account login upon initiation hints at a future pricing structure potentially tied to Gemini subscriptions. While Antigravity targets a comprehensive desktop development experience, Google clarifies its coexistence with Project IDX (Firebase Studio), which remains dedicated to web-based, Firebase-centric development and mobile app emulation. The long-term success of Antigravity is anticipated to hinge on its final pricing model and the continued maturity of its integrated AI capabilities.
