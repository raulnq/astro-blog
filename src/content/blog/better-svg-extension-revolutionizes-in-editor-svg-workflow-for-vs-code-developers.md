A new Visual Studio Code extension, 'Better SVG,' is rapidly gaining traction among developers by directly addressing long-standing frustrations with SVG handling. Developed to streamline the workflow for Scalable Vector Graphics, the extension offers robust inline previewing and optimization capabilities directly within the editor. Prior to Better SVG, developers often grappled with the lack of immediate visual feedback for SVGs, frequently needing to toggle between code and separate preview panels or resort to external tools for optimization. The extension resolves these inefficiencies by embedding real-time SVG previews directly into the editor pane, providing instant visual context.

Better SVG's feature set extends beyond basic previews, offering powerful enhancements across multiple file types. It provides one-click SVG optimization that reports file size reductions while intelligently preserving essential attributes such as `class` names, `onClick` handlers, and `camelCase` formatting, preventing breakage. The extension dynamically adapts to the editor's theme, automatically adjusting preview colors (e.g., black or white) for optimal contrast. Its comprehensive compatibility spans `.svg` files, as well as inline SVGs embedded within `.html`, `.jsx` (React), `.vue` (Vue), and `.astro` components. Also available for Cursor, Better SVG has garnered over 4,200 installations and a perfect 5-star rating from 21 reviewers. As an open-source project, it actively encourages community contributions to further its development.
