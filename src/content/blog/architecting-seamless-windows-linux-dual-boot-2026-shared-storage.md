A detailed guide has emerged outlining a “cleanest dual boot setup” for users aiming to run Linux, specifically Omarchy (an Arch Linux derivative), as their primary operating system by 2026 without fully abandoning Windows. The methodology addresses the common challenge of needing specialized Windows applications, such as Da Vinci Resolve or specific PC-only software, alongside a robust Linux daily driver. This configuration, demonstrated on a desktop PC with dual NVMe drives, focuses on establishing distinct OS environments while providing a seamlessly accessible shared NTFS drive for file transfers and collaborative projects like video editing.

The proposed setup leverages a 1TB NVMe drive for Windows and a 2TB NVMe for Linux, allocating 500GB for Omarchy and dedicating the remaining 1.5TB as a shared NTFS partition. Key technical steps include a manual Omarchy installation to enable precise partitioning, disabling Secure Boot in the BIOS, and utilizing `archinstall` for the base Arch Linux setup. The Linux partition is formatted with BTRFS, including compression and default subvolumes, and secured with LUKS encryption. Post-installation, the Limine bootloader is configured to detect and present both Windows Boot Manager and Omarchy as boot options. Crucially, the shared NTFS drive is initialized in Windows Disk Management, then configured for auto-mounting in Linux via `/etc/fstab` using its UUID and linked to the user's home directory for easy access. A critical final step involves disabling Windows Fast Startup to prevent the shared drive from mounting as read-only in Linux, ensuring seamless read/write access from both operating systems. The creator emphasizes community resources via a blog post and a dedicated community channel for support during the implementation process.
