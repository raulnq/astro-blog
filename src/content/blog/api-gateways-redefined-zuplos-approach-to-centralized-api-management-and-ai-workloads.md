API gateways have emerged as a critical component in modern software architectures, centralizing essential API concerns such as authentication, authorization, rate limiting, request transformation, and observability. Addressing a universal set of problems that arise when exposing APIs to external clients, gateways prevent scattered logic and inconsistent policies across disparate services. They act as a single entry point for all external (north-south) traffic, enforcing policies at the edge before requests reach backend services, whether running on traditional VMs, serverless functions, or Kubernetes. While Ingress controllers in Kubernetes handle basic routing, API gateways extend this with advanced features like developer portals, detailed analytics, and monetization. Crucially, they are explicitly not recommended for internal service-to-service (east-west) communication, where service meshes or native platform tools are more appropriate to avoid unnecessary latency. The rise of AI-powered applications has also spurred specialized AI gateways, which manage LLM provider access, track costs, handle model failover, and rate limit model calls, applying the same centralized control pattern to AI consumption.

Zuplo is presented as a robust, developer-friendly API gateway solution offering both traditional API management and specialized AI gateway capabilities. Its strengths lie in a superior developer experience, featuring code-first configuration, Git-like workflows, and TypeScript for custom logic, complemented by an intuitive UI for visual configuration. A key advantage is its serverless edge deployment across a global CDN, ensuring low latency and automatic scaling without infrastructure management overhead. Zuplo integrates essential features like automatically generated developer portals, comprehensive analytics, and direct monetization integration with Stripe and Open Meter. However, the platform faces criticisms for requiring a duplicated copy of the OpenAPI schema within its project, which can lead to schema drift. Other considerations include its TypeScript-only support for custom plugins and the absence of a self-hosting option, positioning it as a fully managed service ideal for teams prioritizing managed, developer-centric solutions over on-premise deployments or multi-language plugin flexibility.
