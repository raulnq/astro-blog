Vercel recently unveiled its Workflow Development Kit (WDK), introducing new JavaScript directives: `use workflow` and `use step`. The WDK is positioned as a framework for building automated workflows using JavaScript. While these directives are integral to the WDK, they are a Vercel-specific offering and are not additions to the core React library, a distinction that became central to subsequent community discussions. These new directives draw parallels to existing patterns within the React and Next.js ecosystem, such as React's `use server` for server actions, Next.js's `use cache` for data caching, and the older vanilla JavaScript `use strict`.

The announcement of `use workflow` and `use step` triggered polarized reactions within the developer community, largely due to a perception that these were new React-specific features. This interpretation fueled existing developer concerns regarding React's perceived increasing complexity, its growing entanglement with Next.js-specific features, and the proliferation of non-standard JavaScript syntax within the ecosystem. Historically, React has evolved from a concise library for UI development to a more feature-rich framework, with additions like React Hooks and React Server Components (RSC) introducing new patterns and, for some, increased complexity. The fact that RSCs were, for years, predominantly integrated through Next.js, contributed to a sentiment that Next.js often dictates React's evolution. Consequently, the introduction of `use workflow` and `use step`, despite being distinct from React, resonated with ongoing debates about the framework's expanding scope and the blurred lines between core React functionality and platform-specific implementations.
