AMP is emerging as a distinctive intelligent terminal agent for developers, presenting an alternative to established AI coding assistants like Cloud Code and Open Code. Its core philosophy emphasizes delegating complex coding tasks to AI and simplifying interaction with underlying models. Instead of requiring users to select specific models, AMP introduces contextual “modes”—Smart (unrestricted, general-purpose), Rush (cost-effective, faster for specific tasks), and Deep (in-depth reasoning and planning). This approach caters to "B-coders" and project developers who prefer offloading tasks without managing diverse AI models or intricate commands. A notable aspect of AMP is its robust free tier, providing users with 200,000 tokens daily, sustained by subtle in-agent advertising. This model effectively delivers advanced AI capabilities, including those akin to "Cloud Opus," at no direct cost to the user.

Installation of AMP is flexible, supporting common terminal environments across Mac, Linux, and Windows, as well as code editor extensions for chat-like integration. Users navigate AMP through a command palette (Ctrl+O) and can execute direct shell commands. A significant feature is its sophisticated `thread` management system, which enables developers to create isolated contexts for concurrent tasks, switch between ongoing projects, and facilitate collaboration by sharing thread IDs or URLs. AMP also streamlines iterative development by accepting multi-line instructions, interpreting images for UI implementation, and leveraging an extensible `skill` system. This allows for the integration of specialized AI capabilities from repositories like Skills.CS.SH, enhancing tasks such as code optimization or documentation. Additionally, AMP supports advanced features like sub-agents and incorporates an "Oracle" model for complex problem-solving, further abstracting intricate AI operations into user-friendly directives, alongside capabilities for image generation and editing.
