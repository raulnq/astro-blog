Swer is making waves in the 'by coding' landscape by offering a fully integrated development environment that houses both database and authentication capabilities directly within the project. Departing from conventional methods that rely on external services like Supabase, Swer allows developers to deploy a complete Next.js application, including its SQL database schema and authentication flows, with simple checkmark selections. The platform generates full-stack code, encompassing Next.js frontend components, API routes, and corresponding SQL for database management, eliminating the need for external tools or manual integration efforts.

At the core of Swer's offering is its robust AI assistance, designed to accelerate the development lifecycle. Users can initiate project creation with simple text prompts, which the platform's AI can then enhance into detailed functional requirements. This AI also facilitates UI generation from design images, auto-corrects code errors, and assists with refactoring. The integrated editor provides comprehensive tools for code navigation, database inspection, and live preview. Furthermore, Swer supports one-click deployment to its cloud infrastructure, offers code export functionality for deployment on other platforms (available in paid plans), and includes native authentication mechanisms supporting email/password and Google OAuth. The platform provides free credits for new users, a referral program, and a vibrant community showcase, where developers can explore and remix projects created by others.
