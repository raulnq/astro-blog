React Native continues its reign as a premier choice for cross-platform mobile development, enabling Android and iOS applications from a single JavaScript codebase. For 2026, the ecosystem has matured significantly, simplifying development workflows. The recommended approach now centers on **Expo**, which has evolved into a comprehensive framework and ecosystem atop React Native—much like Next.js extends React for web development. Expo provides a robust SDK, a streamlined development environment, and integrated cloud deployment services (EAS), offering an opinionated yet highly beneficial path over raw React Native setups. Key recommendations for the modern stack include **TypeScript** for enhanced code quality, **Expo Router** for file-system-based navigation, and **Expo Modules** for pre-configured functionalities like maps, location, and icons. Productivity is further boosted by AI-powered code editors such as Cursor or VS Code with GitHub Copilot.

Building out the application, developers leverage sophisticated libraries for various concerns. For state management, **Zustand** or **TanStack Query** (the latter excelling in data fetching with caching and deduplication) are favored. Complex form handling is streamlined with **React Hook Form** paired with **Zod** for validation, or the modern **TanStack Form**. UI performance benefits from **FlashList** for large datasets, while **React Native Reanimated** and **React Native Gesture Handler** are indispensable for smooth animations and intuitive user interactions. Styling embraces utility-first approaches with **NativeWind/Uniwind** for Tailwind CSS integration, complemented by UI component libraries like **React Native Reusables** (akin to Shadcn UI) or Expo's native-looking UI kit. Local data persistence is managed with **Expo SQLite** for relational data and **MMKV** for high-performance key-value storage. The deployment process is simplified through **Expo Application Services (EAS)** for cloud builds, and external services like **Clerk** (authentication), **Sentry** (analytics and error tracking), **RevenueCat** (in-app payments), and Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms such as **Supabase** or **InstantDB** complete the modern React Native application architecture.
