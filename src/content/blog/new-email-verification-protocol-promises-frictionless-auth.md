A new 'Email Verification Protocol' is currently in development, aiming to fundamentally change how users verify email addresses on websites. This innovative protocol proposes to eliminate the traditional steps of leaving a website to check an email inbox for a verification code. Instead, it leverages existing browser authentication cookies from email providers (such as Gmail, Outlook, or Yahoo) to confirm email ownership directly within the browser. The process involves the user's browser, acting as the user-agent, securely communicating with their email provider, which then returns a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) indicating successful verification. This token is subsequently passed to the requesting website, streamlining the user experience and significantly reducing friction in registration and login flows.

A key privacy enhancement of this protocol is that the email provider remains unaware of which specific website the user is attempting to verify an email for, mitigating potential profiling risks present in current email-based verification methods. The protocol relies on the user already being logged into their email account within the same browser; if not, traditional verification methods will still be required. Despite its potential to revolutionize web authentication by offering a faster and more private alternative, the proposal has faced considerable skepticism and misunderstanding within the developer community. Concerns around security, the fundamental role of cookies, and the protocol's operational mechanics have been prominent, with proponents needing to clarify that the system's security is congruent with existing cookie-based browser sessions and that the core mechanism involves first-party cookie delegation, not sharing cookies with third-party sites. The protocol is still evolving, emphasizing its optional nature and the robust, token-based security architecture underpinning it.
