A paradigm shift in version control, stacked diffs (or stacked pull requests) are emerging as a critical skill for software developers seeking enhanced productivity and streamlined workflows. This approach involves chaining a series of small, dependent changes, allowing developers to continue working on successive features without being blocked by lengthy code review cycles or upstream merges inherent in traditional Git workflows. While not a new concept—with origins in open-source patch stacks and adoption by tech giants like Facebook (Fabricator), Uber, and Google (Critique)—many developers are only now encountering its profound impact. The core benefit lies in breaking down large tasks into manageable, atomic PRs, fostering quicker reviews and a more asynchronous development rhythm.

The primary challenge with stacked diffs traditionally stems from the complexity of 're-stacking' or rebasing subsequent PRs when a foundational change occurs in a lower part of the stack. This manual overhead often discouraged wider adoption. However, a new generation of tooling is addressing this friction. Graphite, for instance, offers CLI commands that automate the entire re-stacking process, seamlessly updating dependent PRs and simplifying conflict resolution across the stack. This innovation is crucial, especially as GitHub actively explores integrating more robust native support for stacked PRs, acknowledging the need for more efficient methods to manage such sophisticated workflows. The rise of these tools transforms stacked diffs from an efficient but complex practice into an accessible and powerful standard for modern development teams.
