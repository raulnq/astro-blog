Zoer is emerging as a significant player in the low-code/no-code landscape with its AI-powered platform for rapid full-stack application development. Departing from traditional visual builders, Zoer generates entire applications from natural language prompts and UI references, integrating critical backend services by default. The platform boasts robust features, including managed PostgreSQL database integration, a complete authentication system with user registration and email verification, and seamless payment processing through Stripe. A standout feature is its native integration with Nano Banana Pro (powered by Google's Gemini 3 Pro) for AI image generation, enabling functionalities like AI-generated avatars or content features without requiring users to configure external API keys. This comprehensive approach simplifies the creation of production-ready MVPs, Micro-SaaS, and internal tools.

The Zoer development workflow emphasizes speed and flexibility. Users can iteratively refine their applications by providing updated prompts or UI adjustments, with the AI handling the underlying code modifications and responsive design adaptations. The platform automatically manages version control, offering a rollback mechanism for any changes. Developers also gain direct access to database schemas for custom adjustments and the option to export the full Next.js project codebase, providing an escape hatch for advanced customization. Supporting custom domains and a credit-based system for AI usage, Zoer's pricing includes a free tier with 15 monthly credits and professional plans starting at $19/month, positioning it as a versatile solution for entrepreneurs and businesses seeking accelerated application deployment and monetization.
