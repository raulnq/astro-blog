In a recent commentary recorded in November 2025, industry figure 'Uncle Steph' firmly declared the web stack as the paramount technology stack for developers to master by late 2025. The assertion is primarily anchored in the pervasive presence of web applications across all platforms. He highlights that the majority of applications reside on the web, extending even to mobile where Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and standard web apps are increasingly favored over native installations. This preference, he argues, stems from enhanced user security, as web apps generally avoid the extensive device and hardware access permissions inherent to native applications, which are often unnecessary for most app functionalities. Furthermore, the web's 'write once, run anywhere' capability—spanning Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, and even smart TVs—is cited as a significant advantage, drastically reducing development costs and time for businesses by eliminating the need for separate native builds. Major companies already leverage cross-platform technologies like React Native and Flutter, or even simple PWAs, for their mobile strategies.

Beyond technical efficiencies, the speaker emphasizes the substantial career opportunities within web development, ranging from simple branding sites to complex web and mobile applications, catering to businesses of all sizes. This contrasts with more niche 'thick client' development, which he suggests offers fewer roles. A critical driver for web stack relevance is its integral role in the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence. He notes that AI deployment, particularly for new use cases like chatbots and custom GPTs, predominantly occurs through web interfaces, making web development skills indispensable for leveraging AI's potential. Concluding his analysis, 'Uncle Steph' unequivocally advises developers to focus 100% on the web stack, positioning it as the path to maximum opportunity in the current and future tech landscape. He openly invites reasoned debate on his stance, signaling a readiness to consider alternative perspectives if supported by compelling arguments.
