Current logging methodologies, often reliant on basic string-based statements like `console.log`, are proving inadequate for the complexities of modern distributed architectures. While easy to implement, these methods lack crucial context, turning incident debugging into a "detective game" across fragmented logs from numerous microservices, databases, and caches. Experts highlight that systems optimized for monoliths from 2005 fail to provide actionable insights in today's multi-service environments. Even the adoption of OpenTelemetry (OTEL), a valuable standard for telemetry collection, doesn't inherently solve these issues; it's considered "plumbing" that standardizes data transport, but doesn't automatically embed necessary business context or fundamentally alter developers' outdated mental models of logging, often leading to standardized bad telemetry.

The emerging solution advocates for a paradigm shift towards "wide events" or "canonical log lines." This approach involves emitting a single, highly contextualized log event per request, per service hop. These events are rich in "high cardinality" and "high dimensionality" data, including user, business, infrastructure, error, and performance context, effectively providing a complete picture of a request's lifecycle. Instead of logging actions, developers are encouraged to "tag" requests with evolving context, then emit the comprehensive event at the request's completion. To manage the immense data volume, intelligent "tail sampling" is recommended, prioritizing retention of error-related or slow requests and strategically sampling the rest. This method transforms debugging from tedious string-searching to powerful analytics queries on structured data, leveraging modern columnar databases like ClickHouse, BigQuery, or specialized solutions like Axiom, which are optimized for such high-dimensional information.
