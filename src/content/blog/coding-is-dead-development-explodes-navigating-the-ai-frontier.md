A seasoned software developer, known as 'Uncle Steph,' has declared traditional coding as 'dead,' signaling a profound transformation in the software development landscape. He asserts that while coding, as a mere aspect of development, is fading due to AI's ascendancy, the broader field of development is poised for an explosion of opportunities. This evolution mirrors past shifts in the tech industry, such as the transition from 90s web development practices to modern standards or the obsolescence of technologies like Flash and VB6. The core argument is that AI is automating boilerplate code generation and routine tasks, making a new type of development—AI-augmented and AI-first—the dominant paradigm.

This new era emphasizes leveraging pre-existing AI models like Gemini and ChatGPT, along with their downstream technologies and agent toolsets, rather than building foundational models from scratch. Developers are encouraged to focus on creating specialized, AI-powered applications and solutions, often integrating semi-autonomous agents that can be extensively trained for specific tasks. Significant opportunities are identified in servicing small and medium-sized businesses, modernizing their digital infrastructure with AI-driven solutions, including advanced WordPress deployments. To thrive, 'Uncle Steph' recommends mastering the modern web stack (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP/WordPress) and a comprehensive understanding of the AI stack, coupled with practical experience gained through pro bono projects. This shift also points to the obsolescence of certain 'paper shuffling' roles, advocating for a pragmatic, 'boots-on-the-ground' approach to modern development.
