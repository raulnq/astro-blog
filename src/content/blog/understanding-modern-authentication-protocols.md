Authentication remains a cornerstone of software development, crucial for verifying user identity while often needing to be distinct from authorization—the process of defining user permissions. The fundamental flow involves a client sending credentials to a server, which then validates them against a database (where passwords are securely hashed, not stored in plaintext) before responding. Among the common authentication paradigms, Basic Authentication stands as the simplest, encoding a username and password in Base64 and transmitting it with every request. While straightforward, its inherent reversibility makes it less secure, necessitating HTTPS for even minimal protection, and it lacks server-generated tokens, requiring the client to regenerate credentials per request. A significant advancement is Token-based Authentication, exemplified by JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Here, the server generates a cryptographically signed token (containing user data, algorithm info, and a secret) upon successful login, which the client stores (e.g., in cookies or local storage) and sends in an 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' header with subsequent requests. The server then validates this token for access, offering a stateless approach but posing a risk if the token is compromised before its expiration.

To enhance security and user experience with token-based systems, an evolution introduced Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens. Access tokens are short-lived, designed for frequent use and limited exposure, while refresh tokens, with longer lifespans, are securely stored (often in a database like Redis) to request new access tokens when the current one expires. This system allows for proactive token invalidation during logout or security incidents. Moving beyond direct credential handling, OAuth 2.0 provides a powerful framework for delegated authentication, commonly seen in 'Login with Google/Facebook' features. Instead of sharing credentials directly with the application, users authorize an Identity Provider (IdP) to issue a temporary code, which the application's server then exchanges with the IdP for access and refresh tokens. This significantly improves security by keeping user credentials with the IdP and granting users the ability to revoke application access. Building on this, Single Sign-On (SSO) leverages Identity Providers (using protocols like OAuth 2.0 or SAML for enterprise systems) to enable users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple interconnected applications, streamlining access and centralizing identity management across various services.
