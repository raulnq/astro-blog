Seenode, an emerging cloud platform, recently showcased a comprehensive guide to deploying full-stack applications, encompassing backend, frontend, and database components. The platform offers robust support for diverse programming languages and frameworks, including Python (Flask, FastAPI), Node.js (Express, Nest.js, Astro, Next.js), Go, and Elixir (Phoenix). For data persistence, Seenode integrates seamlessly with PostgreSQL and MySQL databases. Noteworthy for its developer-friendly approach, Seenode provides direct integration with GitHub and GitLab, streamlining the Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline. Pricing starts competitively, with plans as low as $0 per month for basic services, including database instances from $1/month and API/frontend deployments from $3/month, complemented by a 7-day free trial for new users. Additionally, Seenode features dedicated sections for deploying background worker applications and anticipates future support for static site hosting.

The practical demonstration involved deploying a full-stack e-commerce application. The backend, built with Node.js and Express, connected to a PostgreSQL database managed through Prisma ORM, showcasing model definition and migration with `npx prisma migrate dev`. A Next.js frontend was then deployed to consume data from this API. Key aspects of the deployment workflow highlighted automatic language and framework detection, configuration of build (`npm install`, `npm run build`) and start commands (`npm start`), and the critical management of environment variables (e.g., `PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, `BACKEND_URL`). The walkthrough also emphasized a best-practice Git workflow, leveraging `.gitignore` for sensitive files like `.env` and `node_modules`, and establishing `dev` and `master` branches for distinct development and production environments. This allows for isolated testing and controlled rollouts via `git merge` and Seenode's specific commit deployment feature, ensuring continuous integration and deployment. Project organization within Seenode is facilitated by a feature allowing developers to group related services (API, frontend, database) under a single project dashboard.
