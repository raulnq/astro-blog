Trae has introduced Solo Coder, a new AI agent mode within its code editor, designed to enhance development workflows for existing projects. This expands on the previously released Solo Builder, which focuses on project creation from scratch. Solo Coder boasts intelligent task planning, precise execution, and a deep understanding of existing codebases. Key features include an integrated terminal and browser preview, allowing direct element selection for in-editor issue reporting, and a "Flow mode" that visually tracks an agent's real-time code modifications, offering an intuitive and interactive development experience.

The agent supports multitasking, enabling parallel execution of complex tasks like SEO optimization and accessibility improvements, with agents intelligently coordinating to prevent file modification conflicts. For substantial changes, Solo Coder offers a planning feature, generating detailed, editable action plans for refactorization (e.g., componentization) or implementing end-to-end tests with Playwright. A prompt optimization button refines user inputs for clearer agent comprehension. Furthermore, developers can create custom agents specialized for specific domains (e.g., SEO), granting them access to tools like Puppeteer, PostgreSQL, GitHub, and Chrome Dev Tools, with Solo Coder contextually selecting the most appropriate agent for a given task.

Early trials indicate Solo Coder performs robust refactoring on existing projects, demonstrating a notable ability to handle file movements and component creation. The editor's visual workflow and task presentation are highly praised, preventing developers from feeling overwhelmed. Trae's pricing model is positioned as developer-friendly, offering the first month for $1, then $10 monthly. The Pro tier provides 600 fast requests followed by unlimited slower requests, ensuring continuous operation without hard quota limits, reinforcing its utility as a persistent "coding companion."
