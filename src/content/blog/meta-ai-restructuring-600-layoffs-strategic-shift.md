Meta has initiated a significant restructuring within its artificial intelligence division, with reports indicating approximately 600 layoffs primarily affecting its Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team. This move, surfacing amidst substantial investments earlier this year, is not signaling a waning interest in AI but rather a strategic consolidation. Following the underwhelming reception of the LLaMA 4 models in April 2025—which, despite strong benchmarks, reportedly failed to meet real-world performance expectations—Meta embarked on an aggressive talent acquisition drive. This culminated in June with the integration of key talent from Scale AI, notably its CEO Alexander Wang, who was subsequently appointed Chief AI Officer. Wang now oversees the newly established Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), which includes a new, elite 'To Be Determined' (TBD) Lab, a recipient of extensive top-tier hiring and multi-million dollar signing bonuses.

The October 2025 layoffs are largely understood as a consequence of this strategic shift, with the FAIR team's prior performance, particularly with LLaMA 4, cited as a critical factor. Meta's revised strategy, reportedly influenced by CEO Mark Zuckerberg's preference for small, high-impact teams, now centers on the TBD Lab as the vanguard for its future AI development. This internal reorganization effectively consolidates Meta's AI efforts under Alexander Wang's leadership within MSL, aiming to streamline operations and intensify focus on cutting-edge models. This move signifies a doubling down on AI investment and top talent, positioning Meta for a more aggressive pursuit of advanced AI and superintelligence, rather than a retraction from the AI frontier.
