React, despite experiencing unprecedented adoption and becoming a de facto standard for AI-driven project builds, faces a period of heightened scrutiny and "heat." Recent weeks have seen the discovery of major vulnerabilities, including one so severe it allowed remote code execution on affected servers. These vulnerabilities are specifically tied to the React Flight Protocol, the custom communication layer underpinning React Server Components (RSC). Developers utilizing frameworks like Next.js are strongly advised to patch their React installations immediately. RSCs, initially introduced in 2020 and made widely available with Next.js 13's app router in 2022, aim to blend server-side rendering for both initial page loads and subsequent updates with client-side interactivity. This is achieved through a proprietary payload, rather than conventional HTML, that describes the application's component tree and state, working in conjunction with Server Actions to facilitate seamless full-stack interactions.

The integration of RSCs and Server Actions has not been without controversy. Early criticisms included a perceived tight coupling with Next.js, making cutting-edge React features seem exclusive to the framework. More significantly, the blending of client and server code has sparked concerns about security. However, expert analysis refutes claims of inherent insecurity in patterns like direct SQL statements within components; these are typically server actions securely executed and sanitized on the server side. A more widely accepted criticism revolves around the increased complexity for developers. Features like RSCs, Server Actions, Suspense, and various optimization hooks have made it challenging for less experienced developers to discern where code executes. While the system is designed to prevent easy misconfiguration, many developers find the mental model of a detached API backend interacting with a client-side SPA simpler to manage. Nevertheless, RSCs address a genuine demand for unified, full-stack application development, offering significant optimization benefits that React is engineered to deliver. Developers retain the flexibility to employ traditional SPA architectures if the blended model does not align with their preferences.
