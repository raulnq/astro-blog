Midu.dev, a prominent figure in the Spanish-speaking developer community, hosted his annual awards ceremony and year-end recap, celebrating the advancements and challenges of 2025 in software development. Among the notable honorees, CSS View Transitions received the 'Internet Explorer Ha Muerto' award for breakthrough web platform technology, praised for simplifying complex page animations previously requiring JavaScript. Astro claimed the 'jQuery de Oro' for Best Web Framework, recognized for its component-agnostic island architecture and growing enterprise adoption. In JavaScript runtimes, Bun was awarded the 'No puedo centrar un DIP' for its all-in-one approach, speed, and integrated functionalities like native SQL and Redis clients. For best code editor, Cursor edged out competitors like Visual Studio Code and Zed, highlighted for its advanced autocompletion and development experience. Finally, TypeScript was crowned with the 'Ada Lovelace' award for Best Programming Language, acknowledging its remarkable growth, increasing adoption in AI contexts, and the anticipated performance boost from its upcoming Go-based compiler.

The event also candidly addressed 2025's technological missteps. React received the 'This is Fine' (Silver) award for multiple critical vulnerabilities, including 'React to Shell,' despite its record-breaking download numbers driven by AI development. Cloudflare, a widely used web infrastructure provider, was given the 'This is Fine' (Gold) award due to recurring and widespread service outages and stability issues throughout the year. Windows 11 garnered the 'Windows ME' award for persistent instability, critical bugs, and disruptive updates. In the realm of Artificial Intelligence, Google's Gemini suite (Flash, Pro, Nano Banana) was awarded the 'Terminator' trophy, recognized for its balanced performance, cost-effectiveness, and unique video interpretation capabilities, with a special mention for the open-source ZEI GLM models. In a non-tech-related but widely discussed award, Javier Tebas, President of La Liga, was playfully (and critically) given the 'Sr. Burns de la Fibra Óptica' award for his controversial actions regarding internet access.

Midu.dev further unveiled a robust roadmap for 2026, promising new educational content, including dedicated courses on the Temporal API, Bun, and building a Zustand-like state management library. He announced the upcoming release of a new book, '100 Cosas que Cualquier Programador Debería Saber' (100cosas.dev), available both physically and as a free digital PDF. A new, free algorithms and data structures platform (algoritmos.dev) with an integrated code editor and AI assistance is also slated for February. The community also celebrated reaching 200,000 followers on Twitch, underscoring the platform's significant engagement. Midu.dev reaffirmed his commitment to the Spanish-speaking developer community, announcing a talk in Spanish at React Miami and the continuation of the GSCAMP InfoJobs bootcamp, reinforcing efforts to elevate the global standing of Spanish-speaking programmers.
