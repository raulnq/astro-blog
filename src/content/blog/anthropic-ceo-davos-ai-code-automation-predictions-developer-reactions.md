At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei made a significant prediction: AI will be capable of writing all code, fully automated and end-to-end, within the next 6 to 12 months. This projection follows a similar statement from early 2023, where Amodei anticipated AI handling 90% of code within 3-6 months. While the earlier timeline proved aggressive, some industry practitioners acknowledge that AI's code generation capabilities have advanced considerably, albeit with caveats.

From a developer's perspective, while AI now writes 80-90% of code for many projects, this is far from full automation or 'wipe coding.' The current reality involves human engineers providing highly detailed plans, including specific libraries, architectural patterns, and step-by-step logic. AI then acts as a 'very fast typer,' implementing these plans. Crucially, the generated code still requires thorough human review, error correction, and steering, as AI models frequently make mistakes. The ultimate responsibility for the code's quality and functionality remains with the human developer. Therefore, while AI can significantly accelerate implementation, it does not autonomously perform the comprehensive tasks of a software engineer, which include strategic planning, architectural design, debugging, security considerations, and taking accountability for the final product. Industry experts express strong skepticism that AI will fully automate these complex, nuanced engineering responsibilities within Amodei's latest ambitious timeframe, viewing today's models as advanced assistants rather than fully autonomous engineers.
