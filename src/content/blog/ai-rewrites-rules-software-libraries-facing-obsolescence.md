The proliferation of AI-powered coding tools is instigating a significant paradigm shift in software development, particularly challenging the long-standing role of external libraries and dependencies. Developers are increasingly opting to "vibe code" custom solutions, often by prompting AI agents, rather than integrating pre-existing packages. This trend is exemplified by instances like the complete rewrite of the React server-side rendering library Tkumi into client-side JavaScript due to bundling issues, and Antirez, creator of Redis, actively gutting C++ libraries in favor of AI-assisted, pure C implementations. Such moves, often leading to substantial code reduction and enhanced control, mitigate risks associated with supply chain attacks, obscure bugs, and the complexities of maintaining external package dependencies.

This reevaluation of library utility is redefining the cost-benefit analysis of adopting external code. While trivial utilities like `is-odd` and `left-pad` continue to see unexpected installation increases—possibly by less experienced developers or as a meme—AI offers a direct solution by making it trivial to generate equivalent in-house code, thereby eliminating security vulnerabilities and integration headaches. For more complex, yet reimplementable, functionalities, AI transforms tedious tasks into viable custom projects. This new landscape fosters concepts like "prompt requests" over pull requests, where developers share AI prompts to generate desired functionality within their codebase. The success of projects like Shadcn/ui, which advocates for direct code copying over package installation, further underscores this shift, as internal codebases provide superior context for AI agents. Strategic decisions by companies like Anthropic, choosing to internally rewrite non-core dependencies while acquiring fundamental ones like Bun, highlight a growing imperative for ownership and control over critical code in the AI era.
