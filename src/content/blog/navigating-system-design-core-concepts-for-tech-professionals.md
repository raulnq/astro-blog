For many in software development, the sheer volume of new system design concepts can be daunting. Recently, a comprehensive overview broke down approximately 30 essential terms, simplifying complex ideas from foundational network interactions to advanced distributed system resilience. The discussion initiated with the ubiquitous Client-Server Architecture, explaining the request-response model fundamental to the internet. This was followed by an exploration of IP Addresses for unique computer identification and the Domain Name System (DNS) for user-friendly URL mapping to IPs. The role of Proxies, both forward (for client privacy) and reverse (for server security and load distribution), was detailed. Latency was highlighted as a critical factor in application responsiveness, emphasizing the importance of server proximity to users. The underlying communication protocol, HTTP, and its secure variant, HTTPS, were thoroughly explained, detailing the structured nature of requests and responses, along with the critical role of encryption.

The session then transitioned into application-level design and data management. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), including REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and SOAP, were presented as methods for server-client data exchange, often utilizing JSON. Databases, categorized as SQL (relational, enforcing ACID properties like Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and NoSQL (flexible, often document, key-value, or graph-based for scalability), were discussed, underlining their diverse use cases. Scaling strategies, distinguishing between Vertical (resource upgrade) and Horizontal (adding instances) approaches, were clarified. Load Balancers, employing algorithms like Round Robin, Least Connection, and IP Hashing, were identified as crucial for distributing traffic in horizontally scaled systems. Database scaling techniques such as Replication (for read operations and high availability) and Sharding (horizontal partitioning for distributed write loads) were outlined, alongside Vertical Partitioning for column-based table optimization. The storage of unstructured data like images and videos was addressed through Blob Storage services (e.g., AWS S3), complemented by Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for faster global content delivery.

Finally, the overview delved into advanced architectural patterns and operational considerations. Microservices were introduced as an alternative to monolithic architectures, advocating for isolated responsibilities and inter-service communication via APIs or Message Queues. Message Queues enable asynchronous processing, decoupling services and improving resilience for intensive operations. Rate Limiting, utilizing algorithms like Fixed Window, Sliding Window, and Token Bucket, was presented as a method to protect servers from excessive requests. The API Gateway was positioned as a central entry point for microservices, handling concerns like authentication, routing, and rate limits. The crucial concept of Idempotency was also explained, ensuring that repeated operations produce the same outcome, particularly vital for transactional systems like payment processing. The presentation underscored that mastering these concepts is fundamental for designing robust and scalable systems in today's complex tech ecosystem.
