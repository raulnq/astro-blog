Perplexity AI, known for its conversational AI search engine, has launched 'Comet,' an AI-native browser designed to transform user interaction with the web. Comet integrates an AI agent directly into the browsing experience, enabling it to perform a wide array of tasks ranging from summarizing web documents, YouTube videos, and social media comments to drafting email responses and managing YouTube Music playlists. The browser also boasts an integrated adblocker and defaults new tabs to Perplexity's AI search, offering a streamlined, AI-first navigation paradigm, though users can opt for traditional Google search with a specific command.

Comet's core innovation lies in its ability to execute complex, multi-step tasks across various websites autonomously. Examples include generating travel itineraries on Google Maps, identifying and unsubscribing from promotional emails, re-ordering past purchases from e-commerce sites like Amazon, and actively navigating pages to find and process information based on user prompts. The browser leverages Perplexity's proprietary models while also offering support for other leading LLMs such as Claude Sonnet, GPT-5, and Grok 4, indicating a flexible and extensible AI architecture. While some advanced features like 'deep research' are exclusive to paid Perplexity Pro plans, Comet represents a significant step towards agentic AI within the browser, foreshadowing a new era where web browsers become proactive digital assistants rather than mere content consumption tools.
