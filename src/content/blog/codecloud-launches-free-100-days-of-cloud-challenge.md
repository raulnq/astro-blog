CodeCloud has officially launched its "100 Days of Cloud Challenge," a new, free-to-join initiative aimed at rapidly upskilling cloud professionals. Positioned as a key opportunity for individuals looking to enhance their capabilities as 2026 approaches, the challenge provides 100 days of hands-on, practical tasks. The curriculum is evenly split, featuring 50 tasks dedicated to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and 50 to Microsoft Azure, ensuring a comprehensive multi-cloud learning experience.

The program is structured to progressively build expertise, starting with beginner-level exercises and gradually advancing to intermediate and expert-tier challenges. Successful completion culminates in several significant outcomes for participants: the creation of a public cloud portfolio detailing all 100 built projects, demonstrable multi-cloud confidence across both AWS and Azure, and the conferment of a CodeCloud verified badge. The platform provides a simulated lab environment, exemplified by tasks like creating security groups in AWS at the beginner stage and expanding EC2 instance storage for development needs by day 50, all with integrated verification mechanisms to confirm task completion.
