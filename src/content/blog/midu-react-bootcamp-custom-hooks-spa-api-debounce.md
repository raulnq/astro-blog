The latest session of Midu's full-stack React bootcamp delved into advanced front-end development, focusing on building a Single Page Application (SPA) from scratch without external dependencies. Key topics included implementing client-side routing using `window.history.pushState` and the `popstate` event, demonstrating how to achieve seamless navigation without full page reloads. The session also covered the `useEffect` hook, emphasizing its role in handling side effects like API fetching, DOM manipulation, and event subscriptions, and the importance of its dependency array for precise control over re-execution. A significant portion was dedicated to custom React hooks, showcasing their power in abstracting complex logic (e.g., `useRouter`, `useSearchForm`, `useFilters`) to enhance code reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

The bootcamp advanced to integrating a real-world API for job listings, transitioning from static JSON data. Participants learned to manage asynchronous data fetching within `useEffect` hooks, handling loading states and dynamic query parameters for filtering and pagination. A critical optimization technique, debouncing user input for search fields, was demonstrated to prevent excessive API calls and improve performance by delaying function execution until a specified idle period. Midu highlighted the practical application of these concepts by explaining the challenges of low-viewership for in-depth code tutorials on platforms like YouTube, advocating for a deeper understanding of underlying principles rather than solely relying on external libraries.

Beyond technical instruction, Midu discussed upcoming topics like React Router and global state management, emphasizing a 'mentalidad de ingeniero' (engineer's mindset) that prioritizes understanding how tools work under the hood. The session also promoted the free Astro course, a domain giveaway, and an upcoming Samsung España Developers event. Community engagement revealed discussions around alternative implementations and the value of building foundational knowledge before adopting advanced dependencies, reinforcing the bootcamp's pedagogical goal to foster true software engineers.
