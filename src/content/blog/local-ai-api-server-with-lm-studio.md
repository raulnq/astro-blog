A new method empowers developers to establish a fully functional, OpenAI-compatible API server locally, leveraging open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) without incurring external API costs. This setup utilizes LM Studio, a versatile application for downloading and executing various open-source AI models, including OpenAI's GPT OSS 20B, DeepSeek, Google Gemma, and Qwen, directly on user hardware. The process, demonstrated on a compact Geekom A6 Mini PC (featuring a Ryzen 7 6800H CPU, Radeon 680M graphics, and up to 64GB RAM, celebrating Geekom's 22nd anniversary), involves installing LM Studio, configuring it for developer mode, and optimizing GPU memory allocation to maximize inference performance, achieving significant improvements in token generation speed.

Once configured, LM Studio exposes a local server with an API fully compatible with the OpenAI API specification, allowing seamless integration with existing tools and SDKs, such as the official OpenAI SDK. Key endpoints like `/models` for listing available models, `/chat/completions` for conversational AI, `/completions` for text generation, and `/embeddings` for vector creation are made accessible. The server can be extended beyond localhost to the local network by enabling "Serve on local NW" and "Enable CORS," facilitating multi-device development and potential custom Copilot-like applications. Demonstrations illustrate client interaction via `curl` and a `bun` project, showcasing both synchronous and streaming responses, with streaming significantly enhancing user experience by displaying tokens as they are generated. This approach offers a private, cost-effective, and highly customizable AI development environment.
