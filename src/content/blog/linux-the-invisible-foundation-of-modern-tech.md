In 1991, a 21-year-old computer science student, Linus Torvalds, released just over 10,000 lines of code online, allowing anyone to use and modify them. This open-source project, with no corporate backing or grand industry plan, evolved into Linux – the foundational kernel underpinning vast swathes of modern technology. More than three decades later, this kernel powers over 3 billion Android phones, the majority of servers managing the internet, and every supercomputer on the planet. Linux, fundamentally a kernel that enables communication between hardware and software, is an open system without a single owner, adapting to diverse needs across various devices.

The Linux kernel is the unseen engine behind many daily interactions. Every Android smartphone, for instance, relies on it for memory management, process handling, and security. On the internet, Linux distros like Ubuntu Server, Debian, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux dominate data centers and cloud platforms, including Microsoft Azure, prized for their stability, advanced permissions, efficient resource management, and native container support. Beyond the data center, Linux is embedded in most home and enterprise routers (TP-Link, Asus, Netgear), directing network traffic and managing Wi-Fi. Smart TVs, running systems like Android TV, Tizen, or WebOS, also leverage Linux to decode video, manage apps, and ensure stable streaming. Perhaps most remarkably, 100% of the world's top 500 supercomputers run highly customized Linux distributions, harnessing its unparalleled control over hardware, scalability, and optimization capabilities for extreme parallel computing, from AI model training to climate simulations. This pervasive adoption stems from Linux's inherent functionality, flexibility, and stability, rather than marketing, making it an indispensable, albeit often invisible, component of our digital world.
