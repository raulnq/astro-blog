SITWP has launched an AI-powered platform designed to significantly automate the initial setup and deployment of WordPress websites, addressing the traditionally manual processes associated with shared hosting and theme installations. The platform leverages artificial intelligence to generate comprehensive WordPress sites, including designs, textual content, and configurations, from simple prompts. A crucial aspect of SITWP's offering is that once a site is generated, users retain full, standard WordPress administrative access, including the familiar dashboard, user credentials, and the ability to install plugins and themes. This ensures developers can continue to customize and manage their sites using popular visual builders like Elementor or Block Builder, without being locked into a proprietary system.

Beyond initial generation, SITWP offers a robust suite of features catering to various development workflows. It supports the creation of temporary 'test sites' ideal for client prototypes, a visual panel for sitemap and wireframe generation, and an integrated AI assistant for on-the-fly content adjustments. A standout feature is 'blueprints,' enabling users to save generated sites as reusable templates for consistent deployments across multiple projects or clients. While SITWP provides hosting, it maintains flexibility by allowing sites to be downloaded for deployment on external hosting environments. The platform also integrates essential functionalities for e-commerce (WooCommerce), appointment scheduling, live chat, and SEO, configurable during the build process. Business-tier plans extend functionality with team collaboration, permanent test sites, advanced caching, DDoS protection, and developer access tools such as SSH/SFTP, positioning SITWP as a comprehensive solution for agencies and high-volume WordPress creators.
