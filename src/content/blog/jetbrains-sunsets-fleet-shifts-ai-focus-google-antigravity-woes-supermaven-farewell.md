JetBrains has officially announced the discontinuation of its experimental code editor, Fleet, with downloads ceasing on December 22, 2025. Fleet was initially conceived as an attempt to explore a new generation of code editors, developed in parallel with the established IntelliJ platform. However, the company concluded that maintaining two distinct IDE families led to confusion and diluted development focus. Rebuilding IntelliJ's extensive capabilities within Fleet did not yield sufficient unique value, nor did Fleet's positioning as another general-purpose editor justify sustaining separate product lines. Moving forward, JetBrains plans to integrate advanced AI-driven workflows more deeply into its existing, specialized IDEs, having determined that another standalone AI-first editor would not adequately differentiate itself in a market already saturated with Visual Studio Code forks. This strategic pivot reinforces JetBrains' long-standing focus on purpose-built development environments tailored for specific technology stacks.

In related news within the code editor ecosystem, Google's Antigravity, a multi-forked editor, has drawn significant user criticism for performance issues, particularly on macOS, with some users labeling it "Google's worst product ever." Reports include severe lag and performance degradation attributed to the editor not utilizing GPU rendering by default on Apple hardware. Command-line workarounds forcing GPU acceleration have emerged as a community-driven solution to mitigate these problems. Adding to the dynamic landscape, Supermaven, known for its rapid and intelligent autocompletion technology, is set to close its services on November 21st, 2023. Its core technology was previously acquired by Cursor, an editor that has successfully integrated Supermaven's engine to enhance its AI-powered code completion and offer a distinct, agentic development experience.
