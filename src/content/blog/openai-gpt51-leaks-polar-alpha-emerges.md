Speculation is mounting that OpenAI is preparing for the imminent release of GPT 5.1, with several pieces of evidence indicating its development and potential stealth deployment. The most compelling technical indicator comes from a discovery within OpenAI's static CDN JavaScript bundles, where references to `GPT51 Pro`, `GPT51`, and `GPT51 Reasoning` have been found, suggesting these model variations are in an advanced stage of preparation.

Further fueling these rumors is the emergence of an anonymous model named 'Polaris Alpha' on Open Router, a platform known for hosting experimental AI models. Analysis of Polaris Alpha reveals a high throughput of up to 114 tokens per second (TPS), significantly outperforming current GPT-5 models in speed. Its unique UI generation style, characterized by specific gradients and visual quirks, strongly resembles outputs from existing OpenAI models like GPT-5 and Codex. Historically, models exclusively appearing on Open Router without concurrent drops on other AI code tools have often been linked to OpenAI's experimental releases, such as 'Horizon Alpha' and 'Horizon Beta.' Benchmarking on platforms like EQbench also shows Polaris Alpha clustering closely with OpenAI's model family. Additionally, recent updates to OpenAI's Codex, including efficiency improvements and increased rate limits, hint at underlying infrastructure optimizations that could be freeing up GPU resources for a new, larger model. A reported jailbreak on Polaris Alpha also reveals its self-identification as 'a large language model from an unknown provider' while acknowledging the structure of OpenAI's unique 'developer messages', further strengthening the connection.
