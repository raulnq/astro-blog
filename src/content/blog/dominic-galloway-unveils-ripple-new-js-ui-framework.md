On November 6, 2025, the JavaScript ecosystem receives a new entry with the unveiling of Ripple, a TypeScript-based, compiler-driven UI framework by acclaimed developer Dominic Galloway. Known for his work on Inferno—an early, performance-focused alternative to React—and subsequent tenures on the React core team (2016) and Svelte core team (2023), Galloway is uniquely positioned to innovate in the UI space. Ripple emerges amidst a historical context of "JavaScript fatigue," a sentiment from the late 2010s about the overwhelming number of free, open-source libraries and frameworks. Galloway's latest project boldly steps into this landscape, suggesting a potential resurgence of complex choices for developers.

Ripple distinguishes itself as a superset of JSX, integrating a `component` keyword for definition and allowing direct conditional statements (if, for loops) within its JSX-like templates—a departure from traditional JSX expressions. Native CSS styling is supported via a `<style>` element, providing scoped and localized component-level encapsulation. Its reactivity model is driven by a `track` function to create mutable values, read and written using an `@` sign prefix, enabling fine-grained rendering for surgical DOM mutations. Although nascent, Ripple already boasts ecosystem support including Prettier, ESLint, a VS Code extension for IntelliSense, and full TypeScript integration.
