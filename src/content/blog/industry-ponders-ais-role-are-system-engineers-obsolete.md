title: "Industry Ponders AI's Role: Are System Engineers Becoming Obsolete?"
description: "A recent declaration by Mario Pergolini suggesting AI eliminates the need for system engineers has sparked strong reactions within the tech community. Experts argue that while AI accelerates tasks, it falls short of replacing human architects responsible for critical infrastructure and problem-solving."

Mario Pergolini recently ignited a debate by asserting that system engineers are no longer necessary, contending that generative AI tools like Gemini, Grock, and Claude empower users to create applications autonomously. He posits that while users must articulate requests effectively and possess strong vocabulary, literature, sociology, and mathematical understanding, such deep knowledge is 'stupid' for engineering professionals. This perspective suggests a future where AI democratizes development, shifting the paradigm from specialized engineering expertise to adept AI interaction.

However, this view faces substantial pushback from tech professionals who highlight AI's inherent limitations and the irreplaceable value of human engineers. Critics emphasize that AI provides answers, whereas engineers deliver comprehensive solutions, encompassing architectural design, cybersecurity, cost optimization, maintainability, and accountability for system reliability. Furthermore, the very AI platforms Pergolini cites rely on the foundational infrastructure designed, built, and maintained by system engineers. Experts argue that while AI can streamline up to 90% of development tasks, the critical remaining percentage—involving complex problem-solving, architectural decision-making, and handling unforeseen failures—demands human intellect. Concerns also rise regarding the impact on junior developers, as the industry continues to prioritize experienced seniors capable of building stable and scalable systems over AI-assisted entry-level programmers. The consensus is that AI serves as a powerful accelerator, not a substitute, for the holistic expertise of system engineering.
