Cursor has emerged as a prominent AI-powered code editor, leveraging a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) fork to deliver a familiar yet enhanced development experience. Its core capabilities revolve around executing AI agents, managing multiple projects concurrently, and facilitating an integrated AI chat for rapid code generation, modification, and debugging. While offering a free/hobby plan, this tier functions as a limited trial, often necessitating an upgrade to the $20/month Pro plan for comprehensive access to features like advanced autocompletion and agent functionality. The editor's autocompletion is notably robust, capable of suggesting and filling significant blocks of code with high accuracy, drastically accelerating development workflows.

Beyond basic functionality, Cursor introduces a suite of advanced features designed for diverse developer preferences. Users can select from various AI models, including Anthropic's Opus and Sonet, OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, or Cursor's proprietary Composer model, with an 'auto' mode available for dynamic model selection. Flexible layouts, such as the multi-agent 'Agent' mode or a minimalist 'Zen' mode, cater to different work styles. An integrated browser tab allows for visual editing, CSS inspection, and direct application of changes via AI agents. For structured project governance, Cursor supports custom commands through `.cursor/commands/*.md` files and enables developers to define AI-guiding rules in `.cursor/rules/rule.md`, ensuring adherence to specific coding standards and architectural patterns.

A key innovation lies in Cursor's support for Model Context Protocols (MCPs), which enable seamless integration with external services like Notion, Figma, Supabase, and Stripe. Noteworthy MCP examples include Context7, providing the AI with up-to-date code context beyond its initial training data, and TestSprite, an AI-powered testing solution that automates test generation, records test execution videos, and assists in creating Product Requirements Documents (PRDs). While the trend of 'vibe coding'—delegating entire tasks to AI—is gaining traction, Cursor's design emphasizes the critical role of human oversight, allowing developers to review AI-generated plans and proposed modifications before implementation. This powerful ecosystem extends VS Code's extensibility, supporting existing language packs, themes, and extensions for a highly customizable development environment.
