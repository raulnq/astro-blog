A live demonstration highlighted the significant advancements and seamless integration capabilities of Next.js 16 and Strapi 5, both recently updated. Key Next.js 16 features explored included 'Cache Components' for efficient function and component caching, the new 'Proxy' mechanism (rebranding of middleware) for request filtering and routing, and 'Next.js Actions' for streamlined server-side form submissions. The session also touched upon TurboPack as the default bundler and the experimental React Compiler. Strapi 5, a leading headless CMS, was showcased for its robust content management capabilities, particularly its new free tier on Strapi Cloud, offering 10,000 API requests and 10GB of storage for production deployments. The ability to deploy Strapi for free underscores its appeal for developers seeking cost-effective backend solutions.

The practical demonstration involved building a full-stack application, leveraging Next.js 16's App Router, React Server Components (RSC) for server-side data fetching, and `shadcn/ui` for frontend components. Strapi 5 served as the backend, utilizing its Content Type Builder to define dynamic content structures like homepages, hero sections, and reusable link components. A user registration flow was implemented using Next.js Actions, incorporating server-side validation with Zod and client-side state management via the `useActionState` hook. Secure user sessions were established by storing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in HTTP-only cookies, with Next.js 16's Proxy protecting authenticated routes. The entire application was successfully deployed to production, with the Next.js frontend hosted on Vercel and the Strapi backend on Strapi Cloud, including the critical `strapi transfer push` command to migrate local content and data to the live production environment. Community feedback during the session indicated strong interest and appreciation for the practical, in-depth exploration of these cutting-edge technologies.
