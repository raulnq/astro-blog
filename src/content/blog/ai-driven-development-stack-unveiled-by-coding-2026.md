The burgeoning field of 'by coding,' where AI generates code from natural language prompts, is primarily targeting non-technical users seeking rapid application development, rather than seasoned programmers. This approach is ideally suited for Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), internal tools, and straightforward informational websites. Professional developers, who demand granular control and scalability for complex, large-scale projects, generally find traditional coding tools more productive.

For those dedicated to by-coding, an expert outlines a pragmatic tech stack for 2026 designed to maximize efficiency and capabilities. For frontend development, b0.dev is recommended due to its capacity to generate full-stack projects using frameworks like Next.js, offering superior SEO and security advantages over client-side rendering platforms such as Lowable or Bolt.new. The backend-as-a-service (BaaS) layer is best served by Supabase, favored over alternatives like Firebase for its modern feature set, including robust databases, authentication, and real-time functionalities. AI integration is facilitated through the OpenAI API, selected for its ease of integration and extensive documentation, with Google AI Studio and OpenRouter presenting viable alternatives. Complementing this, essential cloud services include Resend for transactional emails, Twilio for SMS communications, and global payment gateways such as Paddle, Polar, or Lemon Squeezy, which offer developer-friendly alternatives to regional options like Stripe or Mercado Pago, accommodating diverse geographical and business model needs.

It is crucial to understand that by-coding platforms are engineered for the initial phases of a project, such as concept validation or small-scale solutions. As projects mature in complexity or user base, demanding significant scalability, intricate maintenance, or highly customized features, a transition to a more traditional development stack with greater control becomes necessary. Generated code should ideally be managed via GitHub, enabling future expansion or refinement by technical teams. This underscores by-coding's significant role as a potent tool for rapid prototyping and initial market validation, rather than a comprehensive solution for long-term, enterprise-level software engineering.
