A seasoned industry observer with three decades of experience posits that the trajectory of software development can be understood by examining its past, characterized by recurring cycles of increasing abstraction. Citing a community member's five-stage analysis, the evolution began with punch card batch apps, moving through COBOL mainframes, 1990s GUI client-server applications (C++/VB), and the late 90s/early 2000s web and mobile app era (Java, C#, JavaScript, HTML). The current, fifth stage is defined by AI, encompassing "agentic coding," "vibe coding," and AI-augmented traditional development. A key distinction is "AI-first development," which involves high-level system design and prompt engineering, alongside AI-assisted traditional coding that accelerates existing workflows. Intriguingly, old-school chat-based interfaces are re-emerging, leveraging structured English to guide large language model (LLM) behavior.

The overarching trend across these paradigm shifts is a continuous move towards writing less code to create more sophisticated applications, driven by higher levels of abstraction. Each new language and framework effectively hides the intricate details previously managed at lower levels, much like Java's JVM abstracted platform specifics. While AI offers unprecedented speed and new development paradigms, foundational software development skills remain indispensable. Developers must still understand core coding principles to diagnose AI-generated errors and make critical architectural decisions—such as platform choices (iOS native, React, PHP/WordPress)—that AI can assist but not wholly dictate. Just as master carpenters don't fell trees but work with pre-cut lumber, AI represents the next logical abstraction layer, streamlining the process and allowing developers to focus more directly on problem-solving rather than boilerplate mechanics.
