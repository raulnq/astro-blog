Google has officially unveiled "Anti-gravity," a new AI-powered Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is a direct fork of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and is currently available for free with reasonable usage limits. Leveraging its deep AI capabilities, Anti-gravity integrates extensively with Google's latest models, including Gemini 3 and 2.5, with promises of broader model support upon general release. The IDE incorporates innovative features such as a full browser control mode, enabling AI agents to interact with and generate assets for web pages, and a novel agent manager workflow designed to orchestrate complex development tasks from a dedicated, external interface. This initiative reportedly draws on intellectual property and talent acquired from Windsurf, suggesting a strategic reuse of existing codebase components.

Initial assessments highlight Anti-gravity's impressive potential, particularly its ability to generate functional code and assets—like 3JS and Phaser games—from natural language prompts, demonstrating powerful one-shot capabilities. The integrated browser control further enhances this by allowing AI agents to perform real-time code verification, complete with automated screenshots and video capture. However, early access experiences also reveal a mixed bag of challenges, including numerous bugs, inconsistent thread stability, a notable absence of Git worktree support, and authentication hurdles (initially limited to personal Gmail accounts). Performance issues, such as text input lag, and critical UI/UX flaws—including missing syntax highlighting and non-responsive basic navigation—have also been reported by testers. Despite these early-stage caveats, Anti-gravity's unique agent-centric approach and robust Gemini integration position it as a promising, albeit still maturing, contender in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-driven developer tools.
