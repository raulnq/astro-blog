OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Atlas, a new Chromium-based web browser that deeply integrates its generative AI capabilities directly into the browsing experience. Positioned as an "AI browser," Atlas aims to bring "instant answers, smarter suggestions, and help with tasks" across the web, featuring a unified omnibar capable of handling URLs, search queries, and even image generation. Its standout "Agent Mode" allows ChatGPT to perform complex tasks like summarizing articles, categorizing user feedback, or researching and shopping for trips, interacting with websites autonomously under user control. The browser also introduces "Browser Memories" for enhanced AI responses based on browsing history and is currently available in preview for Plus, Pro, and Business accounts on Mac, with Windows support planned. A notable architectural choice is the incentivization of `aria` tags by website owners to improve agent performance, potentially boosting web accessibility.

Despite its ambitious AI features, early assessments of Atlas highlight numerous user experience and performance shortcomings. Critics point to significant UI bugs, slow responsiveness, non-standard extension management, and a lack of integration with essential browser features like popular password managers. Performance is also a concern, with the browser consuming substantial CPU resources. Security and privacy are key discussion points, with the browser offering both "logged-in" and "logged-out" agent modes to mitigate risks, and expert security researchers like Simon Willison expressing high skepticism regarding potential prompt injection attacks, noting the current defense heavily relies on user vigilance. The underlying motivation for OpenAI's foray into browsers is speculated to be less about direct competition or data collection, and more about "dogfooding" their Codex and other generative AI tools, fostering internal product experimentation, especially given the AI's efficacy in greenfield projects over large, existing codebases. While demonstrating unique AI-driven potential, Atlas is deemed to be in an early, buggy state, lacking the polish and stability expected of a daily driver browser, particularly when compared to more established or specialized AI browsers like Comet.
