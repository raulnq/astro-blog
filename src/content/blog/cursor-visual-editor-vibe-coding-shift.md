Cursor has introduced a new visual editor within its integrated browser, enabling developers to directly manipulate web elements and apply changes via an AI agent. Building upon its existing browser functionality for previewing websites and providing context to AI chats, the new editor allows users to select, drag-and-drop, and configure UI components. While initial changes are visual within the browser, an "Apply" button triggers Cursor's agent to translate these modifications—such as reordering elements or adjusting CSS properties like grid layouts, colors, and fonts—into the underlying HTML and CSS code. For React applications, the editor further extends its capabilities by allowing dynamic configuration of component props for live preview, streamlining the testing and iteration process for UI elements.

This strategic release is interpreted by many as Cursor's concerted effort to enter the "vibe coding" and no-code/low-code space, aiming to attract an audience that may not be traditionally code-fluent. Analysts draw parallels to historical tools like Dreamweaver for visual web editing and modern platforms such as Storybook for component configuration, as well as competitive offerings like Framer and Wix in the design-to-code realm. However, concerns regarding efficiency and cost have emerged, particularly given that every minor visual adjustment currently consumes AI tokens. While the feature's potential to simplify UI development for non-coders is acknowledged, its value proposition for experienced developers who often utilize more direct methods like Chrome DevTools for live visual tweaks remains a point of discussion. The editor's current limitations, preventing visual implementation of complex UI patterns like carousels, suggest a trajectory towards integrating pre-built component libraries for future capabilities, hinting at Cursor's ambition to broaden its market beyond core developers.
