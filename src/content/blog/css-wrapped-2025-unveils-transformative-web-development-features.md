Google's Chrome team has published its 'CSS Wrapped 2025,' signaling a pivotal year for web development with numerous advancements in CSS standards. The report emphasizes the Chrome team's commitment to integrating functionalities directly into browsers that traditionally required extensive JavaScript libraries, such as native dropdown styling and robust popover management. While Firefox continues to close gaps on older standards, Chrome has positioned itself at the forefront of innovation, rolling out features that promise to streamline workflows and reduce dependency on external tooling. This progress comes amidst internal shifts within the Chrome team, including the departures of key figures like Adam Argyle, Nicole Sullivan, and Adi Osmani, yet the pace of development on web standards remains undeterred by concerns regarding AI's potential impact on iteration speed or its generation of parts of the official documentation itself.
