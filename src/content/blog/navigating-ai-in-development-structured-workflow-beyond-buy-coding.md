A recent discussion has illuminated a growing sentiment against 'vibe coding' platforms like V0 and Lovable, citing their limitations in providing granular code control and inhibiting project scalability. Instead, a more nuanced AI-integrated workflow is gaining traction, emphasizing active developer engagement and understanding. This methodology prioritizes a structured approach, commencing with detailed project planning and task management within platforms such as Notion (or Jira for larger teams, Trello for simplicity). ChatGPT is strategically employed to rapidly generate comprehensive project plans and granular task lists, which can then be exported as CSV files for seamless integration into Notion. This significantly streamlines the initial setup phase, allowing developers to concentrate on reviewing and refining AI-generated content rather than manual enumeration.

Further extending AI's utility, the workflow leverages generative AI for critical documentation. ChatGPT can swiftly produce project specifications and intricate Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) in Mermaid format, crucial for both ongoing development and client handovers. For actual code implementation, the focus shifts from generic LLMs to specialized AI coding assistants like Cursor, Windsurf, or AWS Kiro. Claude Code is particularly highlighted for its advanced capabilities, including multi-agent task execution and robust terminal-based interaction, facilitating precise and context-aware code generation. The core principle involves delegating specific, modular coding tasks—such as CRUD operations or API structures—to AI, while maintaining developer oversight. This iterative refinement ensures code quality and project maintainability, departing from blind code generation.
