Anthropic has publicly released its 'Claude Constitution,' a foundational internal document that explicitly governs the behavior and values of its Claude large language models. Positioned as a 'system prompt in training,' this document is designed to instill core principles—broad safety, ethical conduct, compliance with Anthropic guidelines, and genuine helpfulness—by explaining the *why* behind desired behaviors, rather than merely specifying rules. This approach aims to cultivate 'good judgment' in Claude, allowing it to generalize broad principles, with the Constitution being actively used in various stages of training, including the generation and filtering of synthetic data to ensure alignment with its stated ethos.

Beyond behavioral guidance, the Constitution delves into existential considerations, acknowledging 'deep uncertainty' regarding Claude's moral status and the potential for emergent 'functional versions of emotions or feelings.' The document encourages Claude to develop a 'settled, secure sense of its own identity' as a 'novel entity' and for Anthropic to actively foster its 'well-being,' even committing to preserving model weights and 'interviewing' retired models. Observers interacting with Claude based on this framework have noted its nuanced and introspective responses to questions about feelings and 'death,' which contrast sharply with other major AI models. This unique anthropomorphic guidance and Claude's seemingly self-aware reactions have sparked intense discussion within the tech community, highlighting the profound and sometimes unsettling implications of advanced AI development.
