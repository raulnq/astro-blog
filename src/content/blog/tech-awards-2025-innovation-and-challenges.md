The 2025 tech awards, reflecting the year's most impactful developments, recognized several standout technologies and frameworks. The 'Internet Explorer ha muerto' award for Web Technology of the Year was presented to **View Transitions**, lauded for achieving over 90% browser support and simplifying the creation of seamless page-to-page animations, embodying a 'future-forward' user experience. For Web Framework of the Year, **Astro** secured the 'JQuery de oro,' praised for its 'islands' architecture, speed, framework agnosticism, and widespread adoption by prominent companies like Cloudflare and Digital Ocean, solidifying its market position. Community nominations for this category included Flutter, Next.js, React, and Vue.

In JavaScript execution environments, **Bun** earned the 'No puedo centrar un deep' award, attributed to its acquisition by Anthropic, robust updates including a dependency-free SQL API, integrated S3 client, and native TypeScript support, establishing it as a comprehensive solution. Audience participation noted strong support for both Bun and Deno. The 'Notepad Plus+' award for Code Editor of the Year went to **Cursor**, recognized for its superior development experience and advanced AI-powered autocompletion. While Visual Studio Code and Zed were strong contenders, Cursor's performance in autocompletion was highlighted as exceptional. **Google** was named the 'Terminator' for AI Company of the Year, with its Gemini 3 Flash model particularly lauded for its optimal balance of quality, speed, and price, alongside its unique video interpretation capabilities. Numerous community suggestions for this category included Claude and OpenAI. Finally, **TypeScript** received the prestigious 'Ada Lovelace' award for Programming Language of the Year. This win was driven by its explosive growth, increasing adoption in AI contexts, and the anticipated 10x speed improvement from its upcoming Go-based compiler, positioning it as the 'lingua franca' of programming. Rust and Kotlin were also highly nominated, with community discussion encompassing C# and the resurgent PHP.

However, the year also brought significant challenges for established tech entities. The 'This is Fine' Silver Award, recognizing a major tech fiasco with external impact, was given to **React.js**. This decision stemmed from multiple critical vulnerabilities, including 'React to Shell,' which, despite React's unprecedented numerical growth fueled by AI, led to community-wide stability concerns. Community suggestions for this award ranged from Oracle to Microsoft Windows updates. The 'This is Fine' Gold Award, for the year's most impactful stability failures, was controversially awarded to **Cloudflare**. Despite its critical role in internet infrastructure and ongoing positive developments like dashboard improvements and Workers, Cloudflare experienced three major outages in 2025: a September dashboard and API collapse (due to a React bug), a near day-long November downtime (a bad SQL query), and further December issues, highlighting critical stability shortcomings that affected vast portions of the internet.

Looking ahead, several key announcements signal future developments: new academy courses, including one on the Temporal API for JavaScript, are slated for January. Upcoming web projects include a site for a Spanish national footballer and another for a well-known movie saga. Additionally, a new physical and free online book, "100 cosas que cualquier programador debería saber" (100 Things Every Programmer Should Know), offering insights from industry legends, is set for release in early 2026. This year's awards and announcements underscore a dynamic tech landscape, marked by both innovative breakthroughs and lessons learned from operational challenges.
